# App Logos

This folder contains the logos for the apps displayed on the Seagull Technologies website.

## How to Add Logos

1. Add your logo image files to this folder with the following naming convention:
   - For Dresscode AI: `dresscode-logo.png`
   - For future apps: `[app-name]-logo.png`
   - For placeholder "Coming Soon" apps: `coming-soon-logo.png`

2. Recommended logo specifications:
   - Format: PNG with transparency (preferred) or JPG
   - Size: At least 240x240 pixels (will be displayed at 120x120 pixels)
   - Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) is recommended
   - Background: Transparent or white

3. The website will automatically display these logos in the Apps section. If a logo is missing, it will fall back to displaying an icon.
